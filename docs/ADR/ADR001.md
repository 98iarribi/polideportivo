# ADR-001: Initial Architecture and Technology Stack

## Status
Proposed (2025-10-12)

## Context
We are building a system that automatically books padel courts from the municipal sports website. 
The application must:
- Book quickly at 8:00 a.m. when slots open.
- Handle scraping of a third-party web page.
- Be accessible via an API and possibly deployed in the cloud.

We considered multiple languages and frameworks (Python, .NET).

## Decision
We will use **C# .NET Web API** with a **layered architecture** consisting of:

- **API Layer** – Exposes endpoints for booking and history retrieval.
- **Service Layer** – Handles orchestration, scraping logic, and external interactions.
- **Domain Layer** – Contains core entities (User, Booking, PadelCourt, etc.) and business rules.
- **Database Layer** – SQL Server (hosted on Azure/AWS).

We will also use **PlantUML** for architecture diagrams and **Entity Framework** for ORM.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Python FastAPI**: Faster prototyping, easier for scraping, but less structured for enterprise-level hosting.

## Consequences
- Easier long-term maintenance and scalability.
- Can later integrate Azure Functions or AWS Lambda for automation.
- Initial learning curve for .NET hosting and CI/CD setup.

## Next Steps
- Create repository structure following the layered architecture.
- Set up CI/CD for Azure or AWS deployment.
- Implement core domain entities.
